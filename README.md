# README

This is just a symple example of componentization of a webpage using react and next.

The idea is to show that if you design your components right a web designer will have the tools needed to build a very
good site without programming knowledge. Once the webdesigner understands which data comes with each
component, and how adjustable those components are, itÂ´s just a matter of a Lego brick play.

For simplicity purposes, the data is stored directly into internal variables. Next versions will show how to wraparound
some of those components into more complex ones able to retrieve data from a MongoDB.

The current version can be seen running at [https://iramai-page-demo.vercel.app/]
